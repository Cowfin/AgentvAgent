COMP602 - Software Development Practice

Agent v Agent is a game where there is one agent among the crowd who has a list of tasks to do in order to complete their mission. 

But itâ€™s not as easy as it sounds as there is an opposing agent looking for the imposter among the crowd, trying to stop them in their tracks.
